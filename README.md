# SpeeduinoGL
An upcoming library with basic graphical functions optimised for arm cortex m7.
Tested on GIGA R1, with rasterization writing to registers between two lines, and basic shapes (triangle, square). Further rectangle support is under progress,
as well as support for processing arrays instead of pixels one by one, and boundary checking.
